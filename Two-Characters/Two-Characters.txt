Two Characters 

String t always consists of two distinct alternating characters. 
For example, if string t's two distinct characters are x and y, then t could be xyxyx or yxyxy but not xxyy or xyyx.

You can convert some string s to string t by deleting characters from s. 
When you delete a character from s, you must delete all occurrences of it in s. 
For example, if s=abaacdabd and you delete the character a, then the string becomes bcdbd.

Given s, convert it to the longest possible string t. 
Then print the length of string t on a new line; if no string t can be formed from s, print 0 instead.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer denoting the length of s. 
The second line contains string s.

Constraints

s only contains lowercase English alphabetic letters (i.e., a to z).

Output Format

Print a single integer denoting the maximum length of t for the given s; if it is not possible to form string t, print 0 instead.
